1. Are any of your predicted response values from your best model scientifically meaningless? Explain.

Yes, it looks like anything that had to do with nitrogen and its interactions with other values was statistically non significant. This is interesting though, as I (a novice mycologist) would think that the nitrogen would help increase growth rate. I am simply speculating, but it looks as though temp and humidity are simply more important for mushroom growth rate as opposed to nitrogen. 

2. In your plots, did you find any non-linear relationships? Do a bit of research online and give a link to at least one resource explaining how to deal with modeling non-linear relationships in R.

Yes, the scatter plot showing Growth rate and nitrogen was not a linear relationship. It seemed to be almost a bell curve with an ideal rate of nitrogen in the middle.

3. Write the code you would use to model the data found in “/Data/non_linear_relationship.csv” with a linear model (there are a few ways of doing this)

#nonlinear modeling 
#read in .csv (I put a copy in the assignment_8 folder)
non_linear <- read_csv("non_linear_relationship.csv")

#make a simple linear model
mod_lm <- lm(response ~ predictor, data = non_linear)

#summary of model
summary(mod_lm)

#plot model
ggplot(non_linear, aes(x = predictor, y = response)) +
  geom_point(color = "steelblue", size = 1) +  
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color = "black", linewidth = 1) +  
  ggtitle("Linear Model Fit") +
  theme_minimal()
#that sucks
#let's try something else

# Fit linear model to log-transformed response
model_log <- lm(log(response) ~ predictor, data = non_linear)

#predictions
non_linear$pred_log <- exp(predict(model_log))

# Plot
ggplot(non_linear, aes(x = predictor)) +
  geom_point(aes(y = response), color = "steelblue", size = 1) +
  geom_line(aes(y = pred_log), color = "black", linewidth = 1) +
  ggtitle("Log-Transformed Linear Model (Exponential Fit)") +
  theme_minimal()
#much better
